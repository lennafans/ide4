<h1>Show of hands</h1>
<p class="authors">nbs151 (Dan Graakjær) &emsp; and &emsp; xtp778 (Jens Egholm)</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  The following visualisation shows outlines of 40 different hands. Each hand
  is drawn using 56 coordinates. In total that gives us 112 numbers, that
  describes the hand in a 2-dimensional euclidian space. If we wished to
  compare the features of the hands and understand which elements would be
  most important to distiguish between different hands, we would have to
  compare all the 112 numbers of all the different hands.
</p>
<h2>Principal component analysis</h2>
<p>
  Thinking about the 112 numbers, they can be seen as representing one long
  vector of numbers. With a little imagination, this vector can be plotted in
  a 112-dimesional space. Although it would be hard to visualise, this would
  give us a clear view of how each number helps us to tell the hands apart.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately we cannot perceive a 112-dimesional space, so we have to
  improvise. One possible approach is to reduce the dimensionality of the
  space into something we can see (2- or 3-dimensions). This can be done either
  by "folding" the data onto it self, and thus reducing the number of dimensions
  in which the figures extend (manifold), or by trying to find patterns in the
  data that can help us to understand most of it - even when we throw away
  some dimensions. This is called principal component analysis or PCA.
</p>
<p>
  To summarise, PCA tries to find hyperplanes in the data that capture as much
  variance as possible. Variance is a term to describe how much change a
  dimension gives us, and this is what we humans use to distiguish one hand
  from another. If a dimension has very little variance, it does not help us
  very much when distinguishing hands from each other. By finding the
  hyperplanes that can explain more variance than other hyperplanes, we can
  use these hyperplanes as our new dimensions. All the other dimensions will
  then be projected onto that hyperplane.
</p>
<p>
  The final result of this process is the same number of dimensions (112), but
  projected onto different hyperplanes. The first hyperplane in the list is
  able to capture a large part of the variation, the next a little less and
  so on. Each number is called a "principal component" because they are able
  to explain the most significant components in the data. Hence principal
  component analysis.
</p>
<h2>Visualisation introduction</h2>
<p>
  The right and second part of the visualisation shows the first two principal
  components of each of the 40 hands. So each field represents the value of
  the first and second principal component out of all 112. If you hover over
  a field with your mouse, the left visualisation will change to show the hand
  that corresponds to the component values (and in this case coordinates) of
  the field.
</p>
<p>
  We chose to visualise this using a voronoi diagram because we would like to
  make it as easy as possible to examine each component and hand. The diagram
  allows each point to extend in space as much as possible without overlapping
  with other points. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">1</a></sup>

  Figure 1. Changing visualisation of 40 different hands each with 56
  coordinates (left) and a field of the different principal components for each
  of the 40 hands (right).
 </p>

   Text surrounding the visualization which gives an intuitive description of
   the dataset and PCA (introduction), helps the reader navigate the visualization
   (methods), makes observations about the dataset (results) and extract some meaning
   from these observations (conclusion). We expect the last two sections to make
   meaningful and insightful observations.

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
  Moving the mouse to the second visualisation and hovering from the
  left to the right shows a clear pattern in the data. When close to the left
  part of the visualisation, the fingers of the hands are widely spread and the
  hands are short. To the right the fingers are joined and the hands are in
  general longer.
</p>
<p>
  This axis (<code>x</code>) shows the component that explains most variance,
  and it makes sense that a spread hand explains much of the patterns in the data.
</p>
<p>
  Hovering from top to bottom also shows a pattern, although it's arguably
  less prominent. In the top left corner the little, ring and middle fingers
  all point downwards, while the index and thumb points upwards. In the bottom
  left corner, the thumb moves downwards and the middle and ring fingers move
  upwards. The pattern is less clear in the right part, but still visible.
</p>
<p>
  This axis (<code>y</code>) shows the component that explains the second-most
  variance. In that light it makes sense that the pattern is less clear than
  the first component.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  The combination of a visualisation of the raw data and the derived component
  analysis information, gives a strong intuitive understanding of how PCA can
  help to explain data patterns in different ways. Plotting the first two PCA
  numbers on a 2-dimensional plane and letting the user explore it, helps to
  relate the two visualisations to each other.
